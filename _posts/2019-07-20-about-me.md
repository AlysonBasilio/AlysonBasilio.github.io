Hi, my name is Alyson and I am a computer engineer. I studied at a Instituto
Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (ITA), one of the most important universities of Brazil.

I have always liked technology, and now I starting a blog about things I like
to do and learn. I hope you enjoy my posts and like their contents.
