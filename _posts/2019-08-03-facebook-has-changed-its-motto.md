Recently, Facebook has changed its motto from "move fast and break things" to "move fast with stable infrastructure".

It's interesting how things happen when you don't expected them to happen. Four months ago I moved from a team with a work culture of "move fast with stable infrastructure" to a team with a work culture of "move and validate things fast".

At first, I felt strange because of the new team dynamic. Quality of code already was a priority, we always request code review to two others teammates, but test coverage, solution validation and other important development steps didn't have the same spotlight.

Then, what happened increased my understanding of why some development steps "bureaucracy" are really necessary. We started to waste too much time on the same features because on almost every delivery, we had to rework something that wasn't validated or wasn't well tested. In a rush to deliver new features to our product, we put aside important development steps.

After learning with our mistakes, we started to change our feature delivery process. Obviously, we can't have a too bureaucratic feature delivery process because we want to validate things fast, but now we are slowly increasing the quality of our new features, and the older ones too.
